# Visualization

This project makes use of [Three JS](https://threejs.org/) to render the visualizations. We make use of [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction) to act as an abstraction layer over Three JS so that we can use React components to create the visualizations.
